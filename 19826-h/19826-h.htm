<h2>FOREWORD</h2>


<p><img src="images/decocap.jpg" width="69" height="125" alt="I" title="I" class="floatl" />N these little plays I have tried to bring before the public the two
dominant characteristics of the ideal Christmas season, kindness,
expressed by &quot;good will toward men,&quot; and the inward joy wrought by
kind acts, and suggested by &quot;peace on earth.&quot; As Yuletide draws near
we like to think of the swell of Christmas feeling, kindness, peace
and good will, that rises like a mighty tide over the world, filling
it with the fresh, clean joys and generous impulses that produce the
peace that passeth understanding.</p>

<p>Some of the plays are filled with the spirit of fun and jollity that
is always associated with Christmas merrymaking; in others I have
tried to emphasize the spiritual blessings brought to the children of
men on that first white Christmas night when Christ, the Lord, was
born in Bethlehem, and all the angels sang, &quot;Gloria in excelsis, peace
on earth, good will toward men.&quot;</p>


<h3>CHILDREN IN PLAYS.</h3>

<p>The love of mimetic representation, either as a participant or as a
spectator, is an ineradicable instinct of childhood and adolescence.
Most of these plays call for a somewhat large number of children. This
need not daunt the producer as the chief characters are few and many
of the parts have very few lines to speak. Many extra children may be
introduced in several of the plays, as a chorus. At Christmas time,
the children's season, it is best to allow all who so desire to take
part in the entertainment. Some of the parts are rather long, but all
have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span> played by children of the age indicated in the text. Very
little children have sometimes done remarkable work in the plays. I
remember one instance when a very tiny Tiny Tim, who was not four
years old, spoke his part correctly, was heard in every corner of the
church and acted with a naturalness that was indeed remarkable.</p>


<h3>REHEARSALS.</h3>

<p>First and foremost, do <i>not</i> over-rehearse your play. The chief charm
in Christmas plays lies in their naturalness and simplicity, a part of
which is almost sure to be lost if they have rehearsed the play until
they have lost their wonder and excitement and enjoyment in the
make-believe game of amateur theatricals.</p>

<p>The director's aim should be to establish a happy co-operation with
the players that will make the whole production, rehearsals, dress
rehearsals and final performance, a series of good times crowned by a
happy, if not perfect, production. The director should always strive
to be cheerful and happy, ever ready to give advice and ever ready to
ask for advice, even from the youngest players. Take them into your
confidence. Discuss color schemes, costuming, property making,
lighting and scenic effects with your actors.</p>

<p>At the first rehearsal have the children listen to a reading of the
play. Then read a short scene in detail, allowing each actor to read
several parts. Try every child in every child's part before you make
your final selection of the cast of characters. If it is possible,
begin your second rehearsal on the stage where the play is to be
given. Arrange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span> chairs to represent entrances, doors, windows, etc.,
and have all properties on hand, in order to impress on the children's
minds the necessity of learning the words and the action at the same
time. At the third rehearsal the play should be given in its entirety,
music, gestures, entrances, exits, groupings and crossing from one
side of the stage to another at a given cue, etc. In fact, everything
as in the completed production, except that the actors may use their
copies of the play for reading the lines.</p>


<h3>DELAYS.</h3>

<p>The director should make every effort to guard against stage waits and
delays of every sort. Have your stage hands, prompter, property
managers, scene painters and all your assistants on hand at every
rehearsal, if possible. Long waits between the acts, tardiness in
beginning the performance, and all delays do much to destroy an
otherwise happy impression. Every piece of scenery, every costume,
every bit of make-up and every property should be in its place&#8212;all
ready to make a smooth final performance. Dress rehearsals are
absolutely necessary. The last two rehearsals should be complete
performances of the play with lights, curtains, costumes, make-up,
scenery and all incidentals exactly as they are to be on the night of
the performance.</p>

<p>With such preparation, scarcely anything is impossible of attainment.
The pleasure of the work and the pride in a production well done will
amply repay an ungrudging lavishment of time and labor.</p>

<h3>STAGE DIRECTIONS.</h3>

<p>Stage directions are purposely simplified and few abbreviations used.
<i>R.</i> means right of the stage: <i>C.</i>, center; <i>L.</i>, left, etc. The
actor is supposed to be facing the audience.</p>

<h3>MUSIC.</h3>

<p>Music is provided for a few of the songs in this book. The others are
to be sung to old airs that are presumably familiar to everyone. If
any of them should prove unfamiliar, the music of all except some of
the hymns will be found in Denison's &quot;<i>Songs Worth While</i>,&quot; one of the
best arranged and most carefully edited collections of old favorites
ever published. This book is beautifully printed on non-glossy paper,
measuring 7 by 10-1/4 inches, and is well bound in a stout paper cover
done in colors. It may be obtained from the publishers for the price
of $1.00, postpaid.</p>

<p>For all the hymns not included in &quot;<i>Songs Worth While</i>,&quot; see any
standard church hymnal.</p>

<p>And it came to pass in those days, that there went out a decree from
C&#230;sar Augustus, that all the world should be taxed. And this taxing
was first made when Cyrenius was governor of Syria. And all went to be
taxed, every one into his own city.</p>

<p>And Joseph also went up from Galilee, out of the city of Nazareth,
into Judea, unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because
he was of the house and lineage of David. To be taxed with Mary his
espoused wife....</p>

<p>And so it was, that, while they were there, the days were accomplished
that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her first born
son, and wrapped him in swaddling clothes, and laid him in a manger;
because there was no room for them in the inn. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span>.)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prologue.</span></p>

<p>Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the
king, behold, there came wise men from the east to Jerusalem, saying,
Where is he that is born King of the Jews? For we have seen his star
in the east, and are come to worship him.</p>

<p>When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled, and all
Jerusalem with him. And when he had gathered all the chief priests and
scribes of the people together, he demanded of them where Christ
should be born.</p>

<p>And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judea: for thus it is written
by the prophet, And thou Beth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>lehem, in the land of Juda, art not the
least among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.</p>

<p>Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, inquired of them
diligently what time the star appeared.</p>

<p>And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search diligently for
the young child; and when ye have found him, bring me word again, that
I may come and worship him also.</p>

<p>When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the star, which
they saw in the east, went before them, till it came and stood over
where the young child was.</p>

<p>When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great joy.</p>

<p>And when they were come into the house, they saw the young child with
Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him: and when they had
opened their treasures, they presented unto him gifts; gold, and
frankincense, and myrrh.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>The White Christmas.</i></p>

<p>As the three wise men rode on that first Christmas night to find the
manger-cradled Babe of Bethlehem, they bore gifts on their
saddle-bows. Gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. And so the spirit
of Christmas giving crept into the world's heart. We bring our gifts
to the children. Rich children, poor children! The children of the
high and the children of the humble! Poor little sick children&#8212;and
the ragged children of the slums of our cities. Let us remember them
all.</p>

<p>So go ye, all of ye, into the highways and byways, and seek out the
poor and the distressed, the humble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span> and the afflicted, seek out the
ragged children and the outcasts and the aged ones, and in the name of
Him who was born on Christmas day, carry some sunshine into their
hearts! Give unto the poor and the afflicted, and your hearts shall
glow with that inward peace that passeth all understanding.</p>

<p>Then&#8212;and then only&#8212;will you be able to sing with all the company of
Heaven, Glory to God in the highest, peace on earth, good will toward
men! And this will be your pure white Christmas. (<i>Exit</i> <span class="smcap">Prologue</span> <i>at

<h3>THE WHITE CHRISTMAS.</h3>

<h4>WHAT IT MEANS.</h4>

<p>How to make a pleasant, <i>helpful</i> Christmas for the Sunday School is
an annual problem. A tree with gifts, Santa Claus coming down the
chimney, a treat of candy and nuts&#8212;these and many other schemes have
been tried with a greater or less degree of success. But the criticism
is often made that the true significance of the celebration of the
birth of Christ is lost in the mere idea of bartering Christmas
presents. &quot;She didn't give me anything last year, so I'm not going to
give her anything this year.&quot;</p>

<p>One wise superintendent determined to teach his Sunday School pupils
the precious lesson of the beauty of giving. He called his teachers
together a few weeks before Christmas and proposed to eliminate
entirely the idea of &quot;getting something,&quot; and in its stead to try to
teach something of the true spirit of Christmas, the blessedness of
giving.</p>

<p>The children were told that while at home they would receive all the
usual presents, of course they would not get anything whatever from
the Sunday School. The story of Jesus and how He gave His life, and
how He liked best the gifts that cost us something, love, thought,
foresight, charity, money&#8212;was told to the children and they were
asked to save their pennies, instead of spending them for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span> candy and
nuts, to brighten the Christmas Day for God's poor and unfortunate.</p>

<p>It was put to a vote and every little hand was raised, although it may
be confessed that a few went up a little reluctantly.</p>

<p>Teachers and young ladies met a few evenings later and made little
stockings out of cheap cambric, with a cord put into the top of each
in such a manner that it could be drawn together so the pennies would
not be lost out. The stockings were about five inches long, and of
various bright colors, and there were enough for every child. These
were given out two weeks before Christmas.</p>

<p>On Christmas Eve, near the close of the regular program, a large tree
was disclosed, but without a single present on it. The Minister made a
short talk on the joys of giving to the poor and the children marched
up, singing a Christmas carol, and attached their little stocking-bags
to the tree.</p>

<p>Six little boys and girls passed among the congregation with larger
stockings, collecting donations for the tree. These stockings had
their tops neatly sewed around little circles of wire to keep them
open.</p>

<p>The program consisted of Christmas hymns and carols, interspersed with
recitations&#8212;all breathing the spirit of the White Christmas.</p>


<h3>REMARKS ON THE PRODUCTION.</h3>

<h4>SCENERY.</h4>

<p>Hang the rear and the sides of the stage with dark blue curtains,
spangled with small silver bits of tinfoil, to represent very tiny
stars. If the blue curtains are not available, use white sheets.</p>

<p>Cover the floor with white sheets. Have two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span> three small evergreen
trees at rear, covered with white calcimine and diamond powder. Soak
long rags, shaped like icicles, in a strong solution of alum, and then
let them crystallize, then attach them to the trees.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p style="text-align: center">
<img src="images/image02.jpg" width="400" height="276" alt="scenery" title="scenery" /></p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Down right, near the audience, is a doorway, supposed to be the
entrance to the inn. This may be simply an opening between two wooden
columns, with a step or two leading in. A lantern hangs over the door.
A small bench stands by the inn.</p>

<p>Down left, near the audience, is the manger, a building extending out
from left about seven feet. It has a back and one side of scenery or
dark draperies and a thatched roof, covered with twigs or evergreen
branches. There may be a door leading into the manger from the stage,
but this is not necessary, as the characters can go out behind the
manger. A front curtain, of dark goods, conceals the interior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span> of the
manger from the audience until it is withdrawn by Joseph.</p>

<p>The interior of the manger is covered with hay. Rude boxes and farm
implements all around. A large upturned chair with wooden legs may
simulate the crib, if it is concealed by enough straw. An electric
light bulb is concealed in this straw and shines on the face of Mary,
bending over the crib.</p>

<p>If desired, the manger scene may be presented in the choir loft, the
manger hidden by curtains until revealed by Joseph. In this case have
the evergreen trees at the left of the stage and arrange the manger
scene at the rear and elevated above the other scene. This will prove
most feasible in churches where the choir loft is immediately behind
and above the platform.</p>


<h4>LIGHTS.</h4>

<p>Dim all the lights in the audience. Have a powerful searchlight,
engine headlight or two powerful auto lights shining on the stage from
a concealed elevation at the left. Shade these lights with a blue
isinglass shield, thus casting a blue light over the entire stage. Use
a strong yellow light on the manger scene, the rest of the stage being
in darkness.</p>


<h4>PROPERTIES.</h4>

<p>If it is possible have bits of white confetti or finely cut paper fall
from above during the shepherds' scene in Act II.</p>

<p>The bases of the trees should be covered with cotton.</p>

<p>Three rough crooks for the shepherds.</p>

<p>Chimes to ring off the stage. A dinner gong or set of chimes will
answer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>

<p>For the lamb use a white muff, being careful to shield it from the
direct gaze of the audience.</p>

<p>A spray of cherries.</p>

<p>A small bird of blue feathers.</p>

<p>A ball.</p>

<p>A crown and scepter made of gilded wood.</p>

<p>A censor made of metallic butter dish suspended by chains.</p>

<p>A fancy jewel case, supposed to contain myrrh.</p>

<p>Bench in front of inn.</p>

<p>Rude box in front of manger.</p>

cords, will answer admirably in the dim blue light.</p>

<p>Nightgowns, dressing gowns, fur rugs, fur muffs opened, fur stoles,
opera capes, spangled tunics, window cords and chains, etc., will make
valuable substitutes for the oriental garments.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>It is the night before Christmas and the scene is on a big ocean-going
vessel many miles out at sea. Down in the lower part of the ship, in
the steerage, is a group of poor little immigrant children who are
leaving the trials and troubles of the old world behind them and are
looking forward to the golden promises held out by our own &quot;land of
the free and the home of the brave.&quot; But the hearts of the little
immigrants are sad. It is the night before Christmas, and how could
Santa Claus ever hope to reach them away out in the middle of the
ocean? Even the sleigh and the magical reindeers could never be
expected to make such a trip.</p>

<p>Anita, a little Italian girl, alone has faith in the coming of the
good Saint. She is wandering around the ship when all of a sudden,
much to her surprise, she hears a mysterious noise in a great big
barrel, and who should jump out but little Jack Frost himself. Jack
assures her that Santa Claus really is coming to visit the ship, and
more than that, he is going to make an especial trip in an air ship!
And this is little Anita's secret. The children all fall asleep, but
Anita keeps watch for the mysterious aeroplane that will bring joy to
every little heart in the steerage, and, sure enough, just a little
before midnight Anita and Jack Frost look through a telescope and see
the lights of the approaching air ship.</p>

<p>Soon Santa Claus himself is on board, and such a time as he and Anita
and jolly Jack Frost have in arranging a wonderful Christmas surprise
for the children. As an especial favor the good Saint decides to
awaken the children himself very early on Christmas morning. The clock
strikes twelve and it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span> is Christmas Day. The bells of merry Christmas
are heard chiming in the distance, and Santa Claus and jolly Jack
Frost hold a Christmas morning revel with the little immigrant
children away down in the steerage of the big vessel.</p>

with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of
water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the
ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all. (<span class="smcap">Mieze</span>
<i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sano San</span> <i>turn backs to audience and look over the railing into
the water.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda</span> (<i>to the twins</i>). There! Now if you get to see the great big
whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't
it?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they,
Klinker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint
Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best
old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und
visits all the little children in Holland.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny</span> (<i>proudly</i>). Und in Germany, too. (<span class="smcap">Sergius</span> <i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Hulda.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und
things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I
ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Sure. Und me also.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Sergius</span>). On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children
march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star.
And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor.
Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas
fills 'em with candy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Und we put a leedle bit of hay in our shoes for his good
old horsie, Sleipner. Dot makes him happy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> In Germany we call him Santa Claus, und he comes riding in a
sleigh drawn through the sky mit reindeers. Und we have Christmas
trees all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> lighted mit candles und things, und full of toys und paper
stars und angels und apples. But Santa Claus could never get out here
in der middle of der ocean. If he did maybe he'd get seasick already,
und all der reindeers would get drownded in der water.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius</span> (<i>standing R.C.</i>). In Russia there is an old woman named
Babouska who visits all the children on the night before Christmas.
She carries a big basket full of good things.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso</span> (<i>seated on floor at C.</i>). In sunny Italy the children all go
to midnight church on Christmas Eve, and when we make ourselves awake
on Christmas morning, our shoes are all full of candy and chestnuts
and figs and oranges. But of course on a big ship like-a this we'll
not get-a nothing at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker</span> (<i>crying</i>). But I want some presents already.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie</span> (<i>crying</i>). Und me also. I want some presents, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Und Saint Nicholas can't come. Oh, oh! He can't get out on
the big ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Maybe he could float out on a piece of ice yet. Could he,
Hulda?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> No. I don't think he's much of a floater.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> If he did it would make him awful seasick.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> I wish we was landed in New York yet, so I do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Where is Anita? She'll know.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> Yes, Anita will know whether he is coming or not. She knows
almost everything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike</span> (<i>standing at rear L.</i>). Here comes Anita now, and sure
she's having a grand time, so she is.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>comes forward to C. surrounded by the others</i>). Oh, I've just
had the grandest time. It was so superb, magnificent, sublime!
(<i>Extends arms in ecstasy.</i>) I have-a been at the leetla window
watching the great, grand, magnificent ocean. It was all so blue and
so green and so purple&#8212;and the sinking sun is all shining on the
great-a, beeg waves, like-a sparkling diamonds. (<i>Use elaborate
gestures at all times.</i>) And me, the poor, leetla Italian girl, gets
to see all this great-a, grand-a ocean. It is superb, magnificent,
sublime! Ah, I am so happy, I could sing and dance and kees everybody
on the great-a, grand-a earth!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny</span> (<i>at L.</i>). Vot makes you so happy, Anita? Maybe I'd be happy yet
also, if I didn't get seasick once in a while.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> What makes me so happy, Meeny? It's the sun and the waves, and
the sunlight shining like diamonds on the great-a, grand-a ocean. Are
you not also happy, Biddy Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary</span> (<i>standing by</i> <span class="smcap">Anita</span>). I am not. Sure, I niver do be having
time to be seeing diamonds on the great big waves. I have to be hard
at work, so I do, peeling the praties for our Christmas breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I watched the great-a red sun as he began to sink, sink, sink
way down in the ocean. And the beeg-a waves got more beeg and more
beeg and on top of them I saw long white lace fringe. The green silk
waves were all-a trimmed with white lace fringe. And sometimes I think
I see the leetla mermaid fairies dancing in the foam. Leetla green and
white mermaids with the long long-a hair.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso</span> (<i>at R.</i>). You make-a me seek, Anita. There is-a no such
things as fairies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But I love to <i>think</i> there is. It is a great, grand-a pleasure
just to think there is. Is it not, Meeny?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny</span> (<i>stolidly</i>). Oh, sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And that is why we should all be so verra, verra happy. We can
think such-a lovely things. The poor leetla children at-a home, pouf!
They cannot think such things, because they have never seen such a
great, beeg-a ship, or such a great, beeg-a ocean&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> Or a whale.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> Or a sailor man.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> Or a nice little steerage bed built just like a shelf in the
wall.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> Or the great beeg-a engine that makes the ship go.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> Or the tons and tons of coal vay down deep by the cellar.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius</span> (<i>mocking her</i>). Way down deep by the cellar! Whoever heard of
a cellar on board of a ship? You mean&#8212;down in the hatch.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> Hatch? Vot is dot hatch? Dis ain't a chicken, it's a boat.

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker</span> (<i>takes</i> <span class="smcap">Schwillie</span> <i>by the hand and goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Anita</span>). Anita, we

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Well, and what is the question of the leetla Dutch twins?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Tonight is the night before Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> Und we want to know if the good Saint Nicholas is coming
tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I don't know. You see it would be a great beeg-a, long-a trip
way out here on the ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker</span> (<i>half crying</i>). But I want him to come. I've been a awful

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>All the children except</i> <span class="smcap">Anita</span> <i>go out at R., repeating the chorus
of their song.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Surely the good-a Saint Nicholas will come tonight, because
there are so many, many verra good children on board this-a ship.
(<i>Counting on fingers.</i>) There's Hulda from Holland and her two leetla
brothers, the Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum. They
must have a great-a beeg-a Christmas present. And there's Sergius from
Russia, and Meeny and Paddy Mike and Biddy Mary, and Neelda from
Spain, and Yakob and Hans and Ah Goo and Mieze and leetla Sano San
from afar away Japan. They must all have the great-a,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span> grand-a
presents. Maybe I could write old Santa Claus a leetla letter and tell
how good the poor children way down in the steerage have been. And
there's my cousin Tomasso from Italy. Oh, Santa Claus must bring him a
new violin. Then he can make-a the beautiful music on the golden
streets of New York. If there is anybody at all in the whole beeg
world who should have a nice-a, beeg-a Christmas, it is the verra poor
leetla children whose mammas and papas haven't got very much money.
But sometimes the good Santa Claus forgets all about the verra poor
leetla children&#8212;and that's the mostest saddest thing of all, for they
are the verra ones he should remember. When I get to be a great-a,
beeg, grand-a, reech lady in the golden streets of New York, ah! then
I will buy presents and presents and presents, and I will-a give them
to all the verra poor leetla children in the world. I wonder why it is
that the verra good Santa Claus sometimes forgets the poor leetla
children on-a Christmas Day. He never forgets the reech leetla
children, only those who are verra, verra poor. And that is a sad
misfortune. If I had-a nice-a Christmas present, with many candies and
figs and oranges, I could never rest until I had given something nice
to all the poor leetla children in the city&#8212;for that is what makes
the mostest happy Christmas of all.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Sergius</span> <i>from R. quietly. He comes down behind</i> <span class="smcap">Anita</span> <i>and

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> Guess who it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Sergius!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius</span> (<i>disappointed</i>). Why, I thought that you would think it was a
goblin.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Goblin? What is a goblin, Sergius?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> It's a little, wee bit of a man with a long beard. And they
go around having a good time at night. They are always very active on
the night before Christmas. (<i>Looks cautiously around.</i>) I shouldn't
be at all surprised if we should see some tonight.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>frightened</i>). Oh, Sergius, will they harm us?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> Not very much. They just like to have a little fun, that's
all. We have lots of them in Russia. And I believe there are some down
here in the steerage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>grasps his arm</i>). Oh, Sergius! Where are they?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> Well, last night I could not sleep, so I got up and came in
here, and just as I was passing by that barrel (<i>points to barrel up
L.C. where</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> <i>is concealed</i>), I thought I heard a noise. It
was like some one rapping on the barrel. Like this. (<i>Raps on another
barrel.</i>) I thought it was a goblin and I never stopped running until
I was safe in my bunk with the bedclothes around my head.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Pooh! I'm not afraid. No leetla goblin man can make-a me
afraid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> They do wonderful things on Christmas Eve. But come; let us
go to the bottom of the stairs. The ladies and gentlemen are looking
down and Tomasso is playing his violin. Soon they will throw apples
and oranges down to us, and perhaps money. Come and see.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> No, I'd rather wait here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius</span> (<i>crossing to door at R.</i>). All right, but don't let the
goblin man catch you. (<i>Exits at R.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> The goblin man! Poof! There is no such thing as a goblin man.
In-a Italy we do not have such goblin mans. He said he heard something
rap, rap on the inside of the barrel. Poof! Sergius must have been
having one beeg, grand-a dream. Never in all my life did I ever hear
anything go rap, rap on the inside of a barrel. (<i>Stands close to</i>
<span class="smcap">Jack Frost's</span> <i>barrel.</i>) And if I did, I'd think it was a leetla,
weeny-teeny mouse. But a leetla, weeny-teeny mouse never could go rap,
rap on the inside of a barrel, try as hard as he could. It must have
been a dream.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>raps sharply on the inside of the barrel</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, what was that? I thought I heard something. (<i>Goes toward
barrel cautiously.</i>) Maybe it is the leetla, teeny-weeny baby mouse.
(Rises on tiptoes to peer into the barrel.) I'll just peek in and see.
(<i>Just as she looks into the barrel</i>, <span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> <i>pops up his head
almost in her very face.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Hello!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>starting back, very much frightened</i>). Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Did you say oh, or hello?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I just said, oh.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span>. Well, then, hello. (<i>Climbs out of the barrel.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Hello.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>goes to her</i>). You aren't frightened, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>at R.</i>). Well, I'm a leetla frightened, but not verra much.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Why? I won't hurt you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> You came up so sudden. I never expected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> to find a boy in that
barrel. And you are such a queer looking boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Boy? I'm not a boy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> You're not? You look like a boy. You're not a girl, are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). Well, I should say not! I'm just a kind of
a sort of a kind of an idea, that's all. I'm your imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I hope you're not a goblin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Oh, no. I'm not a goblin. They're old and have long
beards. I'm not old at all. (<i>Twirls around on toes.</i>) See, I'm even
younger than you are. (<i>Makes low bow.</i>) I'm a pixie.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And what is a pixie?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> I told you before, it's just your imagination.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> You look like a boy. What is your name?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> My name is Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Claus! Why, what a funny leetla name. I never heard a name like
that in Italy. Claus what?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Santa Claus. Haven't you ever heard of Santa Claus?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span>. Oh, yes; many, many times. But you <i>can't</i> be Santa Claus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>indignantly</i>). I'd like to know why I can't! It's my
name, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But you are not the real, real truly Santa Claus. He is an old,
old man. A leetla fat old man with white-a hair just like-a the snow,
and a long, white-a beard.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Ho, you must be thinking of my daddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Your daddy? Is Santa Claus your daddy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Sure, he is. I'm Jack Frost Santa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> Claus, Jr. Most folks
call me Jolly Jack Frost. The little fat man with the white beard is
my father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Why, I didn't know Santa Claus had any leetla
boys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer,
and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down
Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees.
You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, I'd love to see them.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a
furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most
of the candy comes from mines.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> The mines?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel
mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and
rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right
through the picture-book garden.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little
brothers, and we're all twins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a
wife?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>laughs</i>). Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever
heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Mary? Mary what?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone
knew that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night
before Christmas?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and
takes care of the gardens.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd
be with your father.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Well, maybe I'll tell you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg,
grand-a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> You can keep a secret, can't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your
name's Anita, isn't it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Yes. But how did you know?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Oh, we know everything. How old are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I
am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Well, I just guessed it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Then why don't you guess how old I am?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Cute, ain't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you
must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Cross my heart. (<i>She does so.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>crosses to her</i>). Listen, then; here's the secret. (<i>He
whispers in her ear.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>after a pause, while he is whispering</i>). He is? <i>He is?</i> Oh!!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>nods his head wisely</i>). Yes, he is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Honest?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Honest injun!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>nods head emphatically</i>). Yes, ma'am, every single thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Tonight?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little
children in the steerage are asleep.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Fly.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Fly? But he hasn't any wings. (<span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>nods.</i>) He has? (<span class="smcap">Jack</span>
<i>nods.</i>) Really and truly wings?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>nods</i>). Really and truly wings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> He only bought them this year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Bought them? (<span class="smcap">Jack</span> <i>nods.</i>) Then they didn't grow on him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>laughs</i>). Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only
uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air
ship. (<i>Sits down.</i>) Oh, I'm tired.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I didn't know pixies ever got tired.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> You ought to see the work I've done today.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Here on the boat?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, show me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> I will. But it's part of the secret. (<i>Goes to rear L.</i>)
Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>goes to him</i>). It isn't anything scary, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Of course not. (<i>Lets her peep through the curtain that
conceals the Christmas tree from the audience.</i>) There; what do you
think of that?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words.
Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It
is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell
Tomasso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell
anybody.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But are you really, truly sure he's coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Of course he is. That is our secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I
will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas
surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll
always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus
and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> What are you going to do when you get to America?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span> Spanilli, he haba de
grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr.
Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro
Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Take the monkey's place?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my
tambourine, so! (<i>Poses and holds out tambourine.</i>) And then I will-a
collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>mocking her</i>). I suppose you are going to wear a leetla
red cap and jump up and down this way (<i>imitates a monkey</i>), and say,
&quot;Give-a de monk de cent!&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>laughing</i>). Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and
dance the leetla dance, so! (<i>Hums and dances, or a song may be
introduced at this point by</i> <span class="smcap">Anita.</span>) Then, when I'm finished, I go to
the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so!
(<i>Does so.</i>) And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does
he?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>sighs, then drops a nickel in tambourine</i>). Yes, I guess
he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give
you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin
Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and
Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single
soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing
touches on&#8212;you know what! (<i>Goes behind curtains that conceal the
Christmas tree.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>looks around</i>). Why, he's gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>sticking his head out of the curtains</i>). The sun has set,
it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good-night!
(<i>Disappears back of curtains.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Good-night, Jolly Jack Frost, good-night. Oh, it's the most
wonderful secret in all the world. And won't the leetla children be
glad to know that old Santa Claus has not forgotten them. He said that
Santa Claus was coming tonight in the air ship, and it's got to be
true, it's just got to be true.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Tomasso</span> <i>from R., carrying violin.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> Anita, if you don't hurry you'll not get any supper at all.
It's most eight o'clock.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, I don't care for supper, Tomasso. I could-a not eat. I'm
too much excited to eat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> What make-a you so excited, Anita?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Why, tonight&#8212;(pauses as she remembers her promise) Oh, that I
cannot tell; it's a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> What is the secret?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> If I told-a you, Tomasso, then it would no longer be a secret.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> You should-a not have the secrets from me, Anita. I am your
cousin, also&#8212;I am the head of the family.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But I made the promise not to tell.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> Who you make-a the promise to?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I promised Jack&#8212;(<i>hesitates</i>) I mean, I make-a de promise to
someone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> To Jack! Who is this-a Jack, Anita?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> That is part of the secret. Listen, Tomasso, tomorrow morning
you shall know everything. Early in the morning shall I tell-a you my
secret. That will be my Christmas present to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> All right. I'll wait. Oh, see, Anita, the moon is coming up.
(<i>Points to L.</i>) Just like-a big, round-a silver ball.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Let us stay here and watch the moon, Tomasso.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> You'd better go and get your supper. Those leetla Dutch twins
are eating everything on the table. I think they'd eat the table
itself if it was-a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> I go. (<i>Crosses to door at R., then turns toward him</i>). It's a
awful good-a secret, Tomasso. (<i>Laughs and runs out at R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso</span> (<i>looks off L.</i>). Ah, the great, grand-a lady moon. She looks
at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>(<i>Simple violin solo by</i> <span class="smcap">Tomasso</span>, <i>accompanied by hidden organ or

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary.</span> Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy
Mary?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary.</span> We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we
have for all that. Instead of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span> getting presents, we have the fun of
giving presents&#8212;and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it
is, to make the other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give
presents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker.</span> You can give me some if you want to.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Und me also some.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary.</span> But where would we be getting presents out here in the
middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're
after having on Christmas Day.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers
dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius.</span> In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and
put a fine linen cloth on it. (<i>Produces white lace-edged cloth.</i>)
Here is the cloth, but we have no window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> Here, use this box as a table. (<i>Indicates a large box at rear
C.</i>) Now, let us put the cloth on, so! (<span class="smcap">Hulda</span> <i>and</i> <span class="smcap">Sergius</span> <i>put cloth
on the box.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary.</span> The night before Christmas we always put a big candle, all
gay with ribbons, in the window to welcome the Christ child.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> Here is the candle. (<i>Places it on box at rear C.</i>) Now
I'll light it. (<i>Lights candle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> We do that also in Italy. And we put a leetla picture of the
Christ child on the table. (<i>Puts colored picture of Madonna and Child
back of the candle.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary.</span> On Christmas Day it's the fine old tales we're after
hearing in Ireland, all about the wonderful star that shone so bright
that it turned night into day, and led the Wise Men all the way to
where a little Babe in the manger lay.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> And all the angels sang above of peace on earth, good will

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> I like stockings much better than shoes already, because the

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> Here is my beautiful star. (<i>Produces tinsel star.</i>) That will

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my
daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the
middle of the night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> The middle of the night? What <i>do</i> you mean?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas
we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter
of May,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he
comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about
my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now.
It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see
anything that looks like an air ship, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>looking up and off at R.</i>). No, I cannot see a single thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>sees table at rear</i>). Oh, look here! The children have
lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And
see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem.
And stockings and shoes all in a row.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>looking up and off R.</i>). I can't see a thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Here's a telescope. Look through that. (<i>Takes home-made
telescope from his barrel.</i>) Now do you see anything?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong
end. Turn it around.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>looks up and off R. through telescope</i>). Oh, now I can see the
stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way
off&#8212;far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Fast music, played softly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>looks through the telescope</i>). Yes, I believe it is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>dances wildly about the stage</i>). Oh, he's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> coming, he's
coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm
going to see him. Let me look. (<i>Takes telescope.</i>) Oh, it's getting
bigger and <i>bigger</i> and <span class="smcap">bigger</span>!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Sleigh bells heard outside at R., far away in the distance.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>capering around</i>). Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's
coming!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and <i>closer</i>
and <span class="smcap">closer.</span> Look out, it's going to hit the boat! (<i>Small toy air ship
flies across the stage at rear, with tiny lights twinkling in it.
Stretch a wire across rear of stage and high up, for the toy to run
on.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> He flew right by us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>looking out at L.</i>). Yes, he is. He's landed right over
there. Here he comes; here he comes! (<i>Music and bells louder and
louder.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>runs to L.</i>). Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place.
Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Loud fast music. Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> <i>from L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Hello, there&#8212;where are you? It's so dark I can't see a
single thing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> (<i>shaking hands with him</i>). Hello yourself. Merry
Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for
your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Hello, who's this young person?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> This is Anita.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the
children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> She's such a good little girl that I told her she could
stay up with me and wait until you came.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span> (<i>laughs</i>). Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack
Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus.
See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star
of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and
Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze
and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum.
They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike
they brought the candle. They're good, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>filling them from the sack</i>). Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a
hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in
the steerage.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let
them see you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the
birth of Christmas Day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> And don't you have any other place to go this year?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my
air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the
sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a
Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things
back to the North Pole again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>empties sack on floor</i>). Here they are, daddy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Now, where's the tree?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> (<i>goes to rear of the stage and removes the curtains that
have been concealing the dazzling Christmas tree.</i>). There she is.
Isn't she a beauty?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita.</span> Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Faint chimes are heard in the distance.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry
Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>dancing around</i>). Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry
Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to
all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up! (<i>Shakes her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jack Frost.</span> Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus.</span> Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you
two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and
give Santa Claus a good, old hug!</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>The children all awaken. Rub eyes, stretch, etc.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda.</span> Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come! (<i>Runs and hugs</i> <span class="smcap">Santa
Claus.</span>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Schwillie.</span> Me, too. (<i>Hugs him.</i>) I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?</p>

<p style="text-align: center">(<i>Lights all on full.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Klinker</span> (<i>hugging</i> <span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span>). Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I,
Schwillie Willie Winkum?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny.</span> Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso.</span> And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa
Claus. (<i>The cheers are given.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>bringing</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span> <i>forward</i>). And this is the leetla Jolly
Jack Frost.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike.</span> Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost. (<i>The
cheers are given.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (<i>at C. with</i> <span class="smcap">Jack Frost</span>). This was my Christmas secret. Santa
Claus and the air ship and the Christmas tree and jolly Jack Frost and
everything. This was the secret.</p>

<h3>REMARKS ON THE PRODUCTION OF THE PLAY.</h3>

<h4>THE SCENERY.</h4>

<p>The stage should be set to represent the steerage of a large
ocean-going vessel. A good elaborate set may be arranged with very
little expense by following the diagram. The back drop should be of
light blue with a few cumulus clouds in white. The water line should
be about one-fourth from the bottom,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> and from this line downward the
scene should be darker blue, with white waves.</p>

<p>The background may be made from canvas or paper, as desired. A good
effect has been produced by covering frames with tissue paper of the
desired shades, the clouds and the water lines being cut from white
paper and pasted on.</p>

<p>A railing runs across rear of stage. This railing is made of wood,
with a tennis net serving for the wiring. Round life-savers are cut
from paper, painted and attached to the railing. The ventilator and
hatchways may be made from brown bristol board.</p>

<p>A large Christmas tree, lighted and decorated, stands at rear L. This
is concealed by curtains.</p>

<p>A square box or table stands at rear C. Several barrels and boxes are
at left front, and a box is at right front. A large barrel stands at
left of center near the rear.</p>

<h4>COSTUMES AND SUGGESTIONS.</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Santa Claus</span>&#8212;High boots. Red or brown coat or mackinaw, trimmed with
fur (or cotton, dotted to imitate ermine fur). Cap to match coat.
String of bells around neck. Pack of toys. White hair, mustache and
long, white beard. Rosy cheeks. Do not wear a false-face, as this
often frightens little children and makes the character seem unreal.
When there are little children in the cast, their belief in Santa
Claus must not be disturbed and the adult portraying the character
need not attend the general<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span> rehearsals. The high boots may be shaped
from black oil-cloth and drawn on over black shoes. Use a pillow or
two to give an ample girth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jolly Jack Frost</span> (aged 8 or 9)&#8212;A jolly, little chubby-faced boy who
can memorize and deliver a long part. White stockings and shoes.
Canton flannel suit of white, trimmed with long points cut from cloth,
to represent icicles. Long-pointed cap of white, coming down around
back of head and forming a long-pointed collar in front. The top point
should be wired into position. Face and hands are powdered very white.
Put small dabs of mucilage on the costume and sprinkle here and there
with diamond dust powder. Trim the costume with bits of cotton to
represent snow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Anita</span> (aged 8 or 9)&#8212;Dark hair and complexion. Black slippers with red
rosettes or bows on them. White stockings. Green skirt. Small dark red
apron, edged with white, black and green. Black spencer waist laced in
front showing the white underwaist. Puffed sleeves falling to elbows.
Green and red bows on elbows. Red silk handkerchief laid loosely over
the shoulders. Gold beads around neck. Large earrings may be attached
with court plaster. The headdress is a white oblong cloth, about six
inches wide and about eighteen inches long. This cloth is gayly
decorated with bands of red, green and black ribbons and the part on
the head is padded with a small square of pasteboard. Tambourine
decorated with red, black and green ribbons. A yellow silk
handkerchief may replace the Sicilian headdress above described.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hulda</span> (aged 10)&#8212;A blonde girl with hair in two long braids. Wooden
shoes, white stockings. Sev<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>eral very full underskirts. Long skirt of
dark blue, made very full around the bottom. This skirt is patched
with squares of dark red and striped goods. Large blue gingham apron
edged with stripes of dark red. White waist. Blue bodice of same
material as skirt. Small white cap fitting close to head in back, but
turned back in front with points over each ear. Face round and rosy.
If the wooden shoes are not easily obtained, fair substitutes may be
made by covering an old pair of shoes with cream colored oil-cloth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sergius</span> (aged 9)&#8212;Black oil-cloth leggings to knees. Dark trousers.
Long Russian blouse of dark green coming nearly to knees and belted in
at waist with black oil-cloth belt. Blouse edged with dark fur. Dark
green cap trimmed with dark fur.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Meeny</span> (aged 7)&#8212;Full white waist. Black bodice laced with red. Rather
short red skirt, with black stripes sewed around bottom. White lace
apron edged with red and black. White mob cap, puffed high in front.
Red and black strings on cap which are tied under her chin. She
carries a gray woolen sock, half finished, and knitting needles.
Wooden shoes if possible.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Biddy Mary</span>&#8212;Old shoes and ragged stockings. Old-fashioned dress,
rather short, of plaid gingham. Worn gingham apron. Little square
shawl of red and black checked goods, crossed on breast.
Old-fashioned, little black bonnet tied under her chin. She carries a
pan of potatoes and a knife. Her age is about 8.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Paddy Mike</span>&#8212;Small boy of 7, dressed in a man's suit, cut down in a
clumsy manner. Green vest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> Black swallow-tail coat. Little plug hat,
made by covering a pasteboard form with black cloth. Shoes, old and
worn, and many, many sizes too large for him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tomasso</span>&#8212;Black slippers, white stockings. Red and yellow ribbons wound
around legs. Black knee breeches and zouave jacket. Striped sport
shirt. Red and yellow bows at knees and on shoulders. Red handkerchief
knotted loosely at throat. Black felt hat, turned up side, gayly
decorated with red and yellow ribbons. On his second entrance he
carries a violin. A dark complexioned boy aged about 9.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Dutch Twins</span> (aged 4 or 5)&#8212;Hair in Buster Brown style. Very full
blue trousers extending from under the arms to ankles. These are made
of blue denim and patched with large vari-colored patches. Wooden
shoes. Striped shirts. Dutch caps made of dark cloth, with a peak in
front and a crown about six inches high. The twins should be dressed
exactly alike and look as much alike as possible. Get chubby little
fellows and thoroughly rehearse them in their part; in fact they must
go over it so much that it must come as second nature to them on the
night of the performance. Much of the humor in the play depends on the
little Dutch twins. When they walk let them take long striding steps.
Use frequent gestures, nods, etc., in their dialogue, but be sure and
have every movement exactly the same at each rehearsal. These parts
are not difficult if the little actors are well trained, and their
success on the night of the performance will amply repay the trouble
spent in their proper coaching.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Neelda</span>&#8212;A little brunette girl, aged 4 or 5. Yellow sateen skirt and
zouave jacket, trimmed with coarse black lace. Broad red sash tied on
the side. White baby waist. Black lace mantilla over head, and hair
dressed high with a high comb. Red rose over left ear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ah Goo</span>&#8212;A chubby little Chinese boy of 5. White stockings, black
slippers, white pajamas, slanting eyebrows, small round white cap and
long pig-tail made of black yarn. Carries Chinese kite.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Yakob</span>&#8212;Chubby boy of 6, dressed similar to twins, but in contrasting
colors. Wears yarn stocking cap. Wooden shoes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Hans</span>&#8212;Tall, thin boy of 9. Dressed similar to the twins, but in brown.
Tall black cap similar to those worn by the twins.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mieze</span>&#8212;Little girl of 3 or 4, dressed similar to Hulda, but in dark
red and red and white checked gingham.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sano San</span>&#8212;Little Japanese girl in kimono and sash. Eyebrows slanting.
Hair dressed high. Chrysanthemums over ears. Carries a paper parasol
or fan.</p>

<p>The Christmas tree is for the whole school and is concealed during the
first part of the play by curtains. If there is to be no tree, all
reference to it may be omitted without injury to the continuity of the
play.</p>

<p>Other songs may be substituted for the songs here given, but these
have proved very successful in several performances of Anita's
Secret.</p>

<h3>ARGUMENT.</h3>

<p>Sure, there isn't much argument at all, at all. It's all happiness and
merriment and love, and where there is happiness and merriment and
love there isn't any time for argument. The Widow Mulligan is a
cheerful washerwoman who lives in Mulligan Alley in Shantytown,
surrounded by her ten little Mulligans, to say nothing of the goat,
Shamus O'Brien. A good-hearted neighbor, Mrs. O'Toole, has a lively
time with the goat, but she forgives all his misdeeds as it is
Christmas Eve and the little Mulligans are starting out for a grand
Christmas entertainment. When they return they entertain their mother
and Mrs. O'Toole, and, incidentally, the audience.</p>

<p>But let's have done with the argument and let the fun begin.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget.</span> Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they
shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is
cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy
Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the
poker, and somebody's untied the goat.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan.</span> Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat
at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is
Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin'
disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matsy</span> (<i>whining</i>). Aw, now, maw, I can't go and hunt the goat. I'm all
dressed up for the entertainment. If I go after the goat, sure it's
all mussed up I'll be.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan.</span> Yis, if I swat you one wid this wet cloth, it's worse
than mussed up you'll be. Hurry after the goat. Niver a step does any
Mulligan take from this house tonight until Shamus O'Brien is safe in
the kitchen, wid his horns tied to the wash boiler.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Matsy.</span> Sure, I dunno where to look fer him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan.</span> Go over to Mrs. O'Toole's cabbage garden; like as not
ye'll find him there. Sure, Shamus has a fine appetite for cabbages.</p>

they are call me in and I'll attend to their costumes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget.</span> Maw, Mary Ann's having an awful time. She's growed so that
her skirt and her waist has parted company, and what she'll be after
doing I don't know at all, at all.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan.</span> Is there anything she can use as a sash?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bridget.</span> No'm. Nora and Clarissa have used up all the sashes.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan</span> (<i>takes fringed bureau cover from wash-basket</i>). Look
here, now, Bridget Honora, see what I've found in the wash. It's a
tidy to go on top of a dresser, but I'm thinking it's just the thing
to fill the gap between the skirt and the waist of Mary Ann.</p>

That's what comes of yer growing so fast. Yer skirt is fer six years

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan.</span> Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I

and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it,
it's bound to be most fashionable and select.</p>

folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was
courting each other just like the rest of yeez.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan</span>. Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there
all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking
young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him
up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Toole</span>. Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows
at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a
log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at
him?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan</span>. Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez
are. Will you look at the red color in his face?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. O'Toole</span>. If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I
think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mrs. Mulligan</span>. Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's
a fine girl, if I do say it myself.</p>

Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys,<br />
Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys.<br />
While you are planning for everything nice,<br />
Pray let me give you a bit of advice.<br />
<br />
Don't take it hard if I say in your ear,<br />
Santa, I thought you were partial last year;<br />
Loading the rich folks with everything gay,<br />
Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way.<br />
Now of all times of the year I am sure<br />
This is the time to remember the poor.<br />
<br />
Plenty of children there are in our city,<br />
Who have no fathers or mothers to pity;<br />
Plenty of people whose working and heeding<br />
Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing.<br />
Now, if I came every year in December,<br />
These are the ones I would surely remember.<br />
<br />
Once on a beautiful Christmas you know<br />
Jesus our Saviour was born here below,<br />
Patiently stooping to hunger and pain,<br />
So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame;<br />
Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed<br />
All His poor brothers and sisters who need.<br />
<br />
Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it,<br />
You would remember and certainly do it;<br />
This year, at least, when you empty your pack,<br />
Pray give a portion to all who may lack.<br />
Then, if there's anything left and you can<br />
Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.<br />

<p>Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill
them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest
assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor
Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is
thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old,
to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. (<span class="smcap">Patsy</span>
<i>scratches his nose with his foot.</i>) He arrived last week by parcel
post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife. Oh, you
needn't laugh! It's true. Some of you near-sighted ladies should have
brought magnifying glasses, for Senor Macaroni Spaghetti is the
smallest speck of humanity that ever lived in captivity. He stands<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> on
a silver dollar and puts his hand in a thimble. (<span class="smcap">Teddy</span> <i>makes funny

in his entertaining way.</p>

<h3>NOTES TO THE MANAGER.</h3>

<h4>WHERE THE MULLIGANS LIVED.</h4>

<p>The scenery is very simple or may be dispensed with entirely.
Entrances R. and L. and a window at the rear are necessary. An old
table stands in front of the window, and a larger table, also old,
stands down R. Several soap boxes are down L. and these with an
upturned bucket serve as seats for the Mulligans.</p>

<p>An old rag carpet covers the floor. A wash-tub,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> with wash-board,
clothes, etc., stand at C. Two rickety chairs are on the stage, one
R.C. and one L.C., the latter a rocking-chair. The larger table is
covered with a well worn red cloth and supports an old-fashioned
lighted lamp.</p>

<p>Several tin cans, filled with bright flowers, stand on the table in
front of the window. Curtains or bed comforts are draped over the door
at R. An old sofa stands up L. Colored prints adorn the walls.</p>

<p>A clothes line runs across the stage at rear. On this line several
garments are drying, bright stockings, a union suit, red flannels,
etc. Remember the scene is laid in Mulligan Alley and the stage must
be arranged according to Mulligan taste.</p>

'Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the house<br />
Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;<br />
The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,<br />
In hopes that Saint Nicholas soon would be there.<br />
The children were nestled all snug in their beds,<br />
While visions of sugar-plums danced through their heads;<br />
Grandma in her kerchief and I in my cap,<br />
Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,&#8212;<br />
When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,<br />
I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.<br />
Away to the window I flew like a flash,<br />
Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.<br />
<br />
When what to my wondering eyes would appear<br />
But a wee little sleigh and eight little reindeer,<br />
With a wee little driver, so lively and quick,<br />
I knew in a moment it must be Saint Nick.<br />
More rapid than eagles his reindeers they came,<br />
And he whistled and shouted and called them by name:<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>&quot;Now, Dasher! Now, Dancer! Now, Prancer and Vixen!<br />
On, Comet! On, Cupid! On, Donder and Blitzen!<br />
To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall!<br />
Now, dash away, dash away, dash away, all.&quot;<br />
<br />
So up to the housetop the reindeer they flew,<br />
With a sleigh full of toys, and Saint Nicholas, too.<br />
As I drew in my head and was turning around,<br />
Down the chimney Saint Nicholas came with a bound.<br />
He was dressed all in red from his head to his foot,<br />
And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot.<br />
His eyes, how they twinkled! His dimples how merry!<br />
His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry.<br />
He had a broad face and a little round belly<br />
That shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.<br />
<br />
A wink of his eye and a twist of his head<br />
Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.<br />
He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work<br />
And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,<br />
And laying his finger aside of his nose,<br />
And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.<br />
He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;<br />
But I heard him exclaim e'er he drove out of sight:<br />
&quot;Happy Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!&quot;<br />

I'll be down in the kitchen with the cook. (<i>Goes out at L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> Now we're left all alone.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> I don't see why Aunt Clara couldn't have invited us to her
dinner party, too.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snookums</span> (<i>playing with doll</i>). Snookums likes dinner party.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> It's 'cause we ain't big enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> My, I wisht I was a great, great, great big girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> There, that's a wish that money can't buy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> Grandpa said he'd get us anything we wished for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> What do you wish, Snookums?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snookums.</span> Wish Grandpaw would come home.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> I know a real good wish. I wish it were Christmas every day.
Don't you, Dumpling?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> No, I don't. We'd have to have a present and a tree and a
turkey and plum pudding every day of our lives. We'd get awfully tired
of it after a while. Just think, we'd have to give away about a
million presents every year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> I'll tell you what I really do wish.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> What?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> I wish we could do just like grown up folks do. I wish I was
the biggest little girl in all the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> And I wish so, too. I wish we were just awfully, awfully,
awfully big&#8212;and then we could go to Aunt Clara's dinner party, and
everywhere.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snookums.</span> Me wish me was great big Snookums.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> But money couldn't buy that wish, Dumpling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> No, that's right. But Grandpa said if he couldn't buy our
wish he'd get it some other way.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> How could he get it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> He said he'd tell the Wishing Man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> My, I wonder if there really is such a person!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> I don't know. But I'd like to see him if there is.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Well, pretty nearly anything. Would you like some new
toys?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> Oh, no, thank you. This is Christmas, you know, and we got
ever so many toys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Snookums.</span> Ever so many toys.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> I don't see what you called me for. You seem to have

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Are you sure it's a good wish?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> Oh, yes, it's an awful good wish. You see, we want to be
great big children so we can stay up late at night and go to Aunt

to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Marble?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll
have to stand on marble.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> We have a marble-top table in the front hall.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling.</span> Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> But I have to stand here by the open window.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Tootsy.</span> Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay
here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you
want to be made into great big, big little children?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Children.</span> Yes, all of us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine.
Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll
see what I can do for you.</p>

your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you
have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers
as much as you could have done, but I'll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span> forget all that at Christmas

buds or open flowers. The drums hang down from the branches and the

front of them.</i></p>

growing plants with dolls fastened among the leaves. These are
branches about eighteen inches high, with green paper buds partly
enveloping the dolls.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Well, here we are in the Wishing Land. My kingdom and not
a soul to welcome me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> See 'ittie bitsy teeny weeny trumpets gwowing in twees.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> And the dolls. The lovely, lovely dolls.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>clapping his hands</i>). What, ho! Is there none to welcome
me?</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smcap">Teddy Bear</span> <i>from L.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Bear</span> (<i>comes to</i> <span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> <i>and bows low</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Oh, see the Teddy Bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> And he's the biggest one I ever saw.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> (<i>much frightened</i>). Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Hello, Teddy Bear. Where's your brother?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Bear</span> (<i>shakes head as if he does not know</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Go out and find him for me. Have you been a very, very
good Teddy Bear while I was away?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Bear</span> (<i>nods his head</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> That's good. Now go out and find Jimmy Bear.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Teddy Bear</span> (<i>nods head and ambles out at R.</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>looking around</i>). Everything is growing fine. I think
the bicycle trees need a little more water. Well, children, what do
you think of the Wishing Land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> It's awfully pretty.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> It's perfectly gorgeous.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> Wunnerful, simply wunnerful.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Here's where I grow my toys. See, there is the trumpet
vine, and the candy tree and the dolly flowers. Whenever a little
child makes a wish for anything like that, all I have to do is to come
in here and pick a toy. See?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Oh, lookee at the tin soldiers. They're awful big. Can I have
one, Mr. Wishing Man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> I don't think they're quite ripe yet.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> Me want a twumpet. Want a nice, big twumpet to blow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>picks a trumpet</i>). There you are, my little man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> I want one, too. A nice loud one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>picks one</i>). And there's one for you, Tootsy.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Believe I'll take a drum.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>picks a drum</i>). There you are. Right off the tree.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Now we'll have a parade. (<i>They march around stage playing
trumpets and drums.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Here, here, wait a minute. You're making enough noise to
wake the dead. Hold on, there. Quiet, quiet!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> Oh, dear! Just as we were having such a lovely time.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> Oh, whee! See the funny box. (<i>Goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Ka-zin-ski's</span> <i>box.</i>)
What is in it, Mr. Wishing Man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> You'd better let it alone. That's Ka-zin-ski, and
Ka-zin-ski doesn't like babies.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> But I wish to see him.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Is it a wish?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> No, no. Get up, 'ittie Snookie Ookums, he won't hurt you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Say, Mr. Wishing Man?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> What is it, my little boy?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Can we have anything we wish for here in the Wishing Land?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Of course you can. That's what the Wishing Land is for.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Then I wish I was a little boy again. I'm too big to enjoy
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> And I wish I was a little girl again. Everybody laughs at me,
'cause I'm so big.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> And I wish I was a 'ittie, teeny, weeny baby again. Being so
big fwightens me so.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> Oh, ho! So you all want to be little again?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Three.</span> Yes, sir, if you please.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> Why, I'm so big that I can't get all of me into bed. I'll have
to let my feet hang outside.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big S.</span> And if I get in my baby buggy, I'll bweak it all down.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> And my mamma won't recognize me at all, 'cause I'm grown so
big.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> That's all very well, but it will be quite a job to make
you all little again. It will<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span> take three magic fern seeds, and I

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Oh, what is it, Mr. Wishing Man? Is it the fern seed?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man</span> (<i>looks in the little pill box</i>). Yes, but it's only one
fern seed. Only one of you can be made little again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big D.</span> Give it to my sister, Tootsy. She's a girl.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Big T.</span> No, give it to Dumpling. He's the oldest.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Wishing Man.</span> I think I'll give it to 'ittie Snookie Ookums. Here,
Snookums, take that little seed and go down by the pump and get a

present. And here's another for &#8212;&#8212;. I wonder how my big French dolls
are doing. They're dreadfully hard to raise. They require so much
attention. I have to keep them under cover to protect them from the
sun. The wax melts so easily and the pretty red cheeks are apt to run
down over their pretty French dresses. (<i>Removes cover.</i>) How nice
they look. There's Annette, Olivette and Babette. Three as pretty
little French ladies as ever came out of Paris. I think they're just
about ready to pick. They're such pretty dollies that I think I'll
give them to little boys instead of little girls. I'll give Annette to
(<i>insert little boy's name</i>) and I'll give Olivette to &#8212;&#8212;, and
little Babette I'll give to &#8212;&#8212;. My, my, I was forgetting all about

<h3>REMARKS ON THE PRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>The room was all in shimmering white with a background of small pine
trees in large wooden pots. The floor was covered with white muslin
and scattered with leaves, pine needles and cones.</p>

<p>In one corner was a giant snow pile, made of a frame covered with
cotton. This was presided over by the Snow Queen and her Maids and
white-wrapped bundles were on sale for five cents.</p>

<p>Jack Frost and his boys presided over a large tree in another corner.
Small toys wrapped in white tissue paper were attached to this tree
and sold for five cents. Or Santa Claus may preside at the sale.</p>

<p>Snowballs of white popcorn and snowballs filled with candy were on
sale at another booth, presided over by red and white Striped Candy
Girls. Candy canes were also sold here.</p>

<p>In the fourth corner a snow scene in the woods was depicted. A local
acrobat, dressed as a Snow-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>man, did stunts, assisted by several boys
dressed as clowns. They pelted the Snow-man with snowballs and then
sold bags of white confetti. The Snow-man also ran a game where
snowballs were thrown at a target. The target was a circle of black
cambric, the snowballs were rubber balls covered with raw cotton and
rolled in flour. Balls sold three for five cents.</p>

<p>A postoffice in charge of Mrs. Santa Claus is recommended, where each
pays five cents postage due for packages and postcards.</p>

<p>If snowballing the target is too &quot;mussy,&quot; a large holly wreath with a
cluster of sleighbells in the center may be suspended from the ceiling
with red and green streamers. Three balls of soft rubber are provided
and the contestants try to throw the balls through the wreath and ring
the bells.</p>

<p>Stuffed stockings on a clothesline may be offered for sale. This
should be presided over by Moll Pitcher and her colonial wash-maids.</p>

<p>A rummage sale of toys added quite a large sum to the general fund.
There was a 5-cent table, a 10-cent table and a 25-cent table.</p>


<h4>THE SCENERY FOR THE PLAY.</h4>

<p>The rear of the stage should be hung with dark curtains. Arrange the
trumpet vine and the trees in place before the play begins. Then hide
them with screens, these screens serving as the &quot;scenery&quot; for Act I.</p>

<p>During the progress of Act II, in front of the front curtain, remove
the screens and furniture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span> Act I and arrange the stage for Act III
as described in the text.</p>

<p>For the thunder effect in Act I rattle a large sheet of sheet-iron and
explode several large fire-crackers.</p>

<p>The arrangement of the stage in Acts I and III is fully described in
the text.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Wishing Man</span>&#8212;Dressed as a clown, white suit with red horseshoes on
it. Red ruffles around arms, ankles and neck. Long, pointed, white
clown cap. Face and neck should be covered with white grease paint and
when it is dry apply white powder. Then blacken the nose and lips with
hot black grease paint. Make tiny high eyebrows of this black paint
and paint round black circles on cheek bones.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Grandpa</span>, <span class="smcap">Grandma</span>, <span class="smcap">Father</span> and <span class="smcap">Mother</span> should be dressed in modern
costume, but they must be made up and costumed to look the part.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nurse Maid</span>&#8212;Black dress, long. White apron, collar, cap and cuffs.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dumpling</span>, <span class="smcap">Tootsy</span> and <span class="smcap">Snookums</span>&#8212;Pretty dresses suitable for Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Big Dumpling</span>, <span class="smcap">Tootsy</span> and <span class="smcap">Snookums</span>&#8212;Dressed exactly like their
little counterparts. Wigs, etc.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ka-zin-ski</span>&#8212;Tall boy dressed as a clown. False face. Bushy whiskers
and wig. A regular jack-in-the-box make-up.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Tin Soldiers</span>&#8212;Long trousers of shiny blue cambric with red stripes
at the sides. Shiny red jackets with yellow bands and buttons across
front and on sleeves. Toy guns. The cheeks and lips should be very red
to imitate toy soldiers.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The French Dolls</span>&#8212;Fancy dresses and bonnets. Hair in curls. Faces
painted to represent wax dollies, red cheeks, eyebrows black,
eyelashes beaded with black hot grease paint.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Jim Dandy</span>&#8212;Red and white striped stockings. From the knee to under the
arms the suit is a cylindrical roll of white pasteboard striped with
red. Sleeves and collar white striped with red. Pointed white cap
striped with red.</p>

<p><img src="images/fig02.jpg" width="134" height="266" alt="Fig. 2" title="Fig. 2" class="floatl" /><span class="smcap">The Bears</span>&#8212;Costumes of brown canton flannel, fuzzy side out. Get a
pattern for a child's nightdress with feet. Allow it rather loose in
front, so that a folded knit shawl can be securely fastened (with
safety pins) to the shoulders in front, beneath it, thus making the
round body of the bear. For the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span> back of the suit do not cut the waist
part separate from the legs, as is usual in the pattern, but allow the
waist to be as wide as the seat of the drawers.</p>

<p>Then lay a pleat from A to B on either side, tapering to form a loose
fit below the waist. Sew thumbless mittens to the ends of the sleeves,
padding them a little on the back and sewing on palms of a light tan,
to represent paws.</p>

<p>Fit the seat of the drawers at the back loose enough to give freedom
of motion, but no more.</p>

<p>For the heads, cut hoods like Fig. 3, taking a straight piece of cloth
and fitting it with pleats around the face, etc. Make ears of two
thicknesses of the cloth, stitched and turned like Fig. 4. Lay a
box-pleat at A-B and sew them to the hood at C-D, so that they will
stand out and forward. See Fig. 5. Sew this hood to the neck of the
suit, so that all goes on together. Bear false faces.</p>

their knees, fasten it together in the back and pin on a tail made of
cambric and stuffed. Legs covered with brown burlap.</p>

You don't get a cent. Not a penny!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Wait.</span> All right, sir. Merry Christmas, just the same, sir.
(<i>Exits L.</i>)</p>

Give 'em a shilling, hey? I'd like to give 'em six months in the

is. (<span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> <i>gets down from stool and starts to slink out L.</i>) Hey!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>pauses, turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Scrooge</span>). Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span>. Where you goin'?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> I was just goin' to get a few coals, sir. Just to warm us up
a bit, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> You let my coals alone. Get back to work. I'm not complaining
about the cold, am I? And I'm an older man than you are. Back to work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>sighs, pauses, then says meekly</i>). Yes, sir. (<i>Resumes
work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> You want to let my coals alone if you expect to keep your
job. I'm not a millionaire. Understand? (<i>Loudly.</i>) Understand?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> Yes, sir, I understand. (<i>Shivers, wraps long white woolen
muffler closer about throat and warms hands at candle.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Here it is three o'clock, the middle of the afternoon, and
two candles burning. What more do you want? Want me to end up in the
poorhouse?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> (<i>heard outside at L.</i>). Uncle! Uncle! Where are you? Merry
Christmas, uncle.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> <i>enters from L. He is happy and bright and has a cheerful, loud
laugh. He enters laughing and comes down C.</i></p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>looking up from his work</i>). Oh, it's you, is it?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Of course it is, uncle. Merry Christmas! God save you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>with disgust</i>). Merry Christmas! Bah! Humbug!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Christmas a humbug, uncle? You don't mean that, I'm sure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> I don't, hey? Merry Christmas! What cause have you got to be
merry? You're poor enough.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> (<i>laughing good-naturedly</i>). Come, then, what right have you got
to be dismal? You're rich enough. So, merry Christmas, uncle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Out upon your merry Christmas! What's Christmas time to you
but a time for paying bills without money; a time for finding yourself
a year older, but not an hour richer? You keep Christmas in your own
way and let me keep it in mine.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Keep it? But you don't keep it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Let me leave it alone, then. Much good may it do you! Much
good has it ever done you!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Christmas is a good time, uncle; a kind, forgiving, charitable,
pleasant time; the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the
year, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span> men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up
hearts freely, and to think of people below them in the social scale.
And therefore, uncle, though it has never put a scrap of gold or
silver in my pocket, I believe that it <i>has</i> done me good, and <i>will</i>
do me good; and I say, God bless it, God bless Christmas!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>who had been listening eagerly, claps his hands</i>). Good!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Let me hear another sound from <i>you</i> and you'll keep your
Christmas by losing your job. Get to work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>Resumes his work on the ledger.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span>). You're quite a powerful speaker, sir. I wonder
you don't go into Parliament.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Don't be angry, uncle. Come, dine with us tomorrow.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Dine with you? Me? I'll see you hanged first. Dine with you?
I'll see you in&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>sneezes violently</i>).</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> What's the matter with <i>you</i>? (<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smcap">Fred.</span>) I'm a busy
man. Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Come, uncle; say &quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> No.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> But why? Why?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>savagely</i>). Why did you get married?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Because I fell in love.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Bah! (<i>Resumes his work.</i>) Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> I want nothing from you. I ask nothing from you. But why can't
we be friends?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Uncle I won't part in anger. My dear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span> mother was your only
sister&#8212;your only relation. For her sake let us be friends.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>savagely</i>). Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> I'll still keep the Christmas spirit, uncle. A merry Christmas
to you.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>busy at ledger</i>). Bah!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> And a happy New Year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Good afternoon!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred</span> (<i>goes to</i> <span class="smcap">Cratchit</span>). And a merry Christmas to you, Bob Cratchit.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>getting down from stool, shaking hands with</i> <span class="smcap">Fred</span>
<i>warmly</i>). Merry Christmas, sir. God bless it!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Ay, God bless it! And a happy New Year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> And a happy New Year, too! God bless that, too!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Fred.</span> Ay, Bob, God bless that, too. (<i>Exit L.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Cratchit, get to work!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> Yes, sir. (<i>Resumes work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>looks at him</i>). Humph! Fifteen shillings a week and a wife
and six children, and he talks about a merry Christmas. Humph! (<i>Works
on ledger.</i>)</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>Enter from L.</i> <span class="smcap">Two Mission Lassies</span>. <i>They come down C.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> Scrooge and Marley's, I believe? Have I the pleasure of
addressing Mr. Scrooge or Mr. Marley?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Mr. Marley has been dead these seven years. He died seven
years ago this very night.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> We have no doubt his liberality is represented by his
surviving partner. (<i>Shows subscription paper.</i>)<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Liberality? Humph! (<i>Returns paper to her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lass.</span> At this festive season of the year, Mr. Scrooge, we are
trying to make some slight provision for the poor and destitute, who
are suffering greatly. Hundreds of thousands are in want of common
comforts, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Are there no prisons?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lass</span> (<i>sighs</i>). Plenty of prisons, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> And the workhouses&#8212;are they still in operation?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> They are, sir; but they scarcely furnish Christmas cheer
for mind and body. We are trying to raise a fund to buy the poor some
meat and drink and means of warmth.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lass.</span> We chose this time because it is a time when want is
keenly felt and abundance rejoices. What shall we put you down for?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Nothing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> You wish to be anonymous?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> I wish to be left alone. I don't make merry myself at
Christmas, I don't believe in it. And I can't afford to make idle
people merry. They should go to the poorhouse.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Second Lass.</span> Many of them would rather die, sir, than do that.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>savagely</i>). If they would rather die, they'd better do it
and decrease the population. And besides, I am a very busy man.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> But, sir&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Good afternoon.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> I'm sorry, sir. Sorry&#8212;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Sorry for them?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Lass.</span> No, sir, I'm sorry for you, sir. Good afternoon. (<i>Exits
L. followed by</i> <span class="smcap">Second Lass.</span>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Sorry for me, hey? (<i>Pause. He works. The clock strikes
five.</i>) Sorry for me!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>closes his book, blows out candle</i>). Is there anything
more, sir? (<i>Comes to C.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> You'll want all day off tomorrow, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> If it's quite convenient, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Well, it isn't&#8212;and it's not fair. If I'd dock you a half a
crown for it you'd think I was ill using you, wouldn't you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit</span> (<i>nervously</i>). I don't know, sir.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> And yet you expect me to pay a full day's wages for no work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> It only comes once a year, sir. Only once a year.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> A poor excuse for picking a man's pocket every twenty-fifth
of December! But I suppose you've got to have the whole day. But you
be here all the earlier next morning.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Cratchit.</span> Oh, yes, indeed, sir. (<i>Goes out R.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> I'll stay here a bit and finish up the work.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Ask me who I was.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> Well, who were you, then?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> In life I was your partner, Jacob Marley. It is required of
every man that the spirit within him should walk abroad among his
fellow-men, and if that spirit goes not forth in life, it is condemned
to do so after death.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> You are fettered. Tell me why.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> I wear the chain I forged in life. I made it link by link, yard
by yard, the heavy chain of avarice. Now I must make amends for the
opportunities I neglected in life.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> But you were always a good man of business, Jacob.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Business? Mankind should have been my business. Kind actions,
charity, mercy, benevolence, love&#8212;all should have been my business. I
am here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span> tonight to warn you, to warn you, Ebenezer Scrooge, that you
have yet a chance of escaping my fate.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> You were always a good friend to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> You will be haunted by Three Spirits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> If it's all the same to you, I think I'd rather not.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ghost.</span> Without their visits, you cannot hope to escape my fate. Expect
the first when the bell tolls one.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit.</span> Then why haven't you followed his good example? Would
any of your clerks say that you were the kindest master that ever

Ebenezer Scrooge.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>astonished</i>). Small? It was the happiest time in my life.</p>

mortal money. Three or four, perhaps. And yet he kindled the true
spirit of Christmas in all your hearts.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span>. He could have made us miserable, but he made every day we
worked for him seem like Christmas.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit</span> (<i>gazes steadily at Scrooge, who becomes uneasy under the

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge</span> (<i>trying to appear unconcerned, but failing</i>). Oh, nothing!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit</span> (<i>gazing at him</i>). Something, I think.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> No, nothing; only this, I wish I could say a word or two to
my clerk just now. That's all. Poor fellow. I'm afraid I've been a

<p><span class="smcap">Ebenezer</span> (<i>irritated</i>). What idol has displaced you in my heart?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> An idol of gold.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Ebenezer.</span> Well, I must make money. You know that. Poverty is the
hardest thing in the world.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bella.</span> I have seen your nobler instincts fall off one by one. Now
nothing remains in your heart but the love of gold. Therefore, I am

chosen, Ebenezer Scrooge?</p>

thing in my life, for gold. And now I'm alone, alone. (<i>Sinks at desk

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit.</span> I have shown shadows of times that are passed. Have you
learned a lesson from the Spirit of Christmas Past?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> I have, I have; a bitter, bitter lesson.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit.</span> And will you see more?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Scrooge.</span> No, no. Show me no more. Torture me no longer.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">First Spirit.</span> Remember the lesson you have learned. Remember the
kindness of your old master. Remember the love of your old sweetheart.
Your life is barren and bitter, but there is yet time for repentance.
(<i>Bell tolls twice.</i>) The signal! My hour is past. On the stroke of

Remember! Repent! Believe! Farewell, farewell, farewell!</p>

tied with a huge pink bow.</i>) Mercy! Another pin-cushion cover. That
makes six I have already. Cost about twenty cents, and I sent her a
perfectly lovely doily embroidered with scarlet forget-me-nots. I'll
never send Rannie Stewart another present as long as I live. (<i>Throws
box and wrappings into waste basket.</i>) Pink! And she knows my rooms
are in blue and yellow. Eddie!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie.</span> Yas'm.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Here's a little Christmas present for you. (<i>Hands it to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie</span> (<i>reads card on it</i>). &quot;Merry Christmas to my Darling Kittens.&quot;
Is dat for me?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Oh, no; not the card, just the embroidery.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie</span> (<i>holding it up</i>). Lawdy, Mis' Williams, what is dis yere? A
dust cap?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> It's a cover for a pin-cushion. Isn't it a dear?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie.</span> I hopes you'll excuse me, but honest I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span> hain't got no more use
for dat thing dan a pussy cat has for a hot water bottle.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>opening larger package</i>). Throw it in the waste basket, Eddie.
This is from Warren. I know the handwriting. It looks like a hat.
(<i>Opens box and removes wrappings, disclosing a hideous red and orange
hat.</i>) Heavens, what a nightmare! Red and orange and a style four
years old. It must have come from the five and ten cent store. Look at
the plume! Oh!</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie</span> (<i>admiring it</i>). Um-um, dat shore am a fine present. Your
husband certainly am a man ob taste, he shore am.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>sarcastically</i>). Yes, he has wonderful taste, hasn't he? A
little bizarre. No, it's more than bizarre; it's baroque.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie.</span> It looks like a hat to me.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> I know what I'll do. (<i>Wraps it up and puts it back in box.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Eddie.</span> Dat certainly was a nice present, Mis' Williams. Must have cost
a heap of money.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> It probably did. But it isn't my style. And Madame Brunot never
exchanges hats. What a shame! I suppose he paid an enormous price for
it and I could have satisfied myself with one for half the money. If

presents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warren.</span> That's what comes of promiscuous giving. I told you how it

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> But I told Lolly we'd take tickets from her.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Warren.</span> I know. I haven't bought the tickets yet. I meant the money

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty</span> (<i>recovering</i>). Oh, yes, indeed, Mr. Googin. But it is a far too

wife. Here, I'll wrap it all up again.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Googin.</span> But me wife won't wear orange.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Kitty.</span> Tell her to take off the orange and replace it with a green

<p><span class="dropcap">C</span>OME&#8212;let's pretend!&quot; has been the slogan of all childhood. A few gay
feathers have transformed an everyday lad into a savage warrior; a
sweeping train has given a simple gingham frock the dignity of a court
robe; the power of make-believe has changed a bare attic into a gloomy
forest or perhaps into a royal palace. These six plays will appeal to
the imagination, to the fun-loving nature and to the best ideals of
all children.</p>

<h2>Impromptu Magic, with Patter</h2>

<p style="text-align: center">By GEORGE DE LAWRENCE</p>

<p><img src="images/image14.jpg" width="143" height="204" alt="book" title="book" class="floatl" /></p>

<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> supreme collection of clever, off-hand tricks that can be presented
with little or no practice, require no sleight-of-hand skill and are
independent of any apparatus. The only articles called for are
ordinary coins, cards, matches, etc., such as are always at hand. An
excellent line of patter, in which humor predominates, is included for
each trick and there are numerous illustrations.</p>

<p>Among the many clever but easy effects taught may be mentioned the
lemon and dollar bill trick without sleight-of-hand, several baffling
mind reading effects, card in the pocket, vanishing drinking glass,
penetrating match, traveling coins, four-coin trick, coins out of hat,
dime and penny trick, swallowing a knife, torn and restored paper
napkin, etc.</p>

<p>Dr. A.M. Wilson, editor of &quot;The Sphinx,&quot; who contributes the
introduction, says:</p>

<p>&quot;Many books and booklets on patter, numerous works, little and big, on
magic, have been published. But not until this work of DeLawrence has
there been one that covered both, and with material that anyone of
reasonable intelligence could use successfully and satisfactorily.
Having read the manuscript I congratulate the author on his wise
selection of tricks and on the sensible and appropriate patter.&quot;</p>

life. The humor is essentially human, and not merely witty. Various

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
